### Step-by-Step Guide:

#### **Step 1: Create a New Bot Using BotFather**

1. **Open Telegram** and search for **[BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)** in the search bar.
   
2. **Start a chat** with BotFather by clicking the “Start” button.

3. Use the command `/newbot` to create a new bot.
   
4. **Name your bot**: BotFather will ask for a name for your bot. Example: `"MyMenuBot"`.

5. **Create a username** for your bot. The username must end with the word "bot". Example: `"mymenubot"`.

6. After successful bot creation, BotFather will provide a **Token**. This token is essential for managing your bot. Keep it secure.

   Example of the token: 
   ```
   123456789:ABCD1EF2G3H4I5JK6LMNOPQRST7UVWXYZ
   ```

   Congratulations! Your bot is now created, and you have your **Token** to use in future steps.

#### **Step 2: Customize Your Bot Using MenuBuilderBot**

Next, you can use **[MenuBuilderBot](https://t.me/MenuBuilderBot)** to create a functional interface for your bot without writing code.

1. **Search for MenuBuilderBot** in Telegram and start a conversation by clicking the "Start" button.

2. **Register Your Bot** with MenuBuilderBot by sending the token you received from BotFather.

   Example:
   ```
   /token 123456789:ABCD1EF2G3H4I5JK6LMNOPQRST7UVWXYZ
   ```

   MenuBuilderBot will confirm the bot is registered and ready to be configured.

#### **Step 3: Build the Menu for Your Bot**

MenuBuilderBot allows you to create interactive buttons and menus for your bot. Here’s how you can set it up:

1. Use `/add_menu` to create the main menu.
   
   Example: 
   ```
   /add_menu Main Menu
   ```

   This command creates a main menu called "Main Menu."

2. **Add Buttons** to your menu using the `/add_button` command.

   Example:
   ```
   /add_button Main Menu About Us
   ```

   This creates a button named "About Us" in the "Main Menu."

3. **Link a message or action** to the button by specifying the content.

   Example:
   ```
   /set_content About Us
   ```
   After sending this, type the message you want the bot to display when someone clicks the "About Us" button, e.g., `"We are a service providing ..."`.

#### **Step 4: Add Additional Menus or Submenus**

You can create multiple menus or submenus and add more buttons to them.

1. To create a **submenu**, use the same `/add_menu` command.
   
   Example:
   ```
   /add_menu Services
   ```

2. Now add buttons for this new submenu.
   
   Example:
   ```
   /add_button Services Web Design
   /add_button Services Mobile App Development
   ```

3. Set content for each button:
   ```
   /set_content Web Design
   ```
   Then, send the message like, `"We offer custom web design services."`

   Repeat this for the other buttons.

---

#### **Step 5: Preview and Activate Your Bot**

1. Once you've added all the buttons and menus, you can preview your bot by opening it (search for it using its username).

2. Click on the buttons to ensure that they work as expected.

3. If everything is functioning as planned, your bot is ready for use!

     - About Us
     - Services

Here’s the process:

1. **BotFather**:
   ```
   /newbot
   Name: InfoBot
   Username: myinfobot
   ```

2. **MenuBuilderBot**:
   ```
   /token 123456789:ABCD1EF2G3H4I5JK6LMNOPQRST7UVWXYZ
   /add_menu Main Menu
   /add_button Main Menu About Us
   /add_button Main Menu Services
   /add_button Main Menu Contact

   "You can reach us at contact@company.com."
   /add_menu Services
   /add_button Services Web Development
